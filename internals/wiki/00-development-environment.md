# Setting up your development environment

This part is optional, you can use your own development environment and tools.

The development environment described here is the most commonly used one and the one we recommend.

1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) together with the [GraphQL plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.vscode-graphql).
1. Clone the [repository](https://kkhoshnoodpour@scm.ecom.ahold.nl/stash/scm/~maarten.van.oudenniel/sandbox-graphql.git).
1. Run `yarn` from the root folder of the cloned folder
1. Open the cloned folder using VSCode

Now we're all set!
