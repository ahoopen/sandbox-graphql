# GraphQL Workshop

Welcome to the GraphQL tutorial. This purpose of this tutorial is to get you up and running with GraphQL. And to introduce the most important concepts of implementing GraphQL and using it in applications.

In this tutorial you'll build a small application from the ground up. Each chapter has one ore more assignments, and they conclude with possible solutions.

To get the most out of this workshop we recommend solving the assignments on your own, and using the solutions as comparison or if you're really stuck . The workshop presentation together with the information in the chapters contain everything you need to solve the assignments.

If you can't solve the assignments, we still encourage you to follow along and learn about GraphQL by reviewing the chapter solutions.

Each chapter builds on the previous, so you can start at any chapter by checking out the solution branch of the previous chapter.
