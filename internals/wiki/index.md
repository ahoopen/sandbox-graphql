# Graphql Workshop

[Setup Introduction](./setup/index.md)
More information about the setup we provide, is optional. You know how to run the application by simply starting `yarn dev`, but in this chapter we will explain you the tools being used and the places which are interesting to know about when you start making the excersises.

Add your own list...

9. [Consuming a real service](./9-consuming-a-real-service.md) [frontend][backend]
    > You will find the answer in branch 'chapter-9-solutions'. There are bonus questions with their answers in 'chapter-9-bonus-1|2|3'. You can connect to any service after this excersise and understand how important typing of services is, and how to think about typing it in a GraphQL way.

x. [spacex ships](./mpth-spacex.md)
[frontend] [backend]
topics: extension, dataloader and cacheControl
> Use branch master and do the tasks, You will find the solutions in branches 'mpth-spacex-solution-x'. Besides the normal assignments you can also experiment yourself of reusing the dataloader for a specific ship and see you can totally reuse the same dataloader without any more code!
